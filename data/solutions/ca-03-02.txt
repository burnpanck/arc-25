**Hypothesis:**
- Black background.
- One horizontal and one vertical colored dotted line.
- Impossible to say which of the two is painted over the other.

**Rule:**
- Start either from the input, or a fully black canvas of the same shape.
- First, paint a solid vertical line at the position and in the color of the dotted vertical line in the input.
- Second, paint a solid horizontal line at the position and in the color of the dotted horizontal line in the input.

**Plan:**
- There are no distractions, so we can determine the line positions simply from the count of foreground cells.
