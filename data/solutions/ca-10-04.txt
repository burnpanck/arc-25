**Hypothesis:**
- Black background.
- Two closed lines (connectivity 8) of arbitrary single color (each one different),
  not crossing each other;
  one completely encloses the other
- A single cell colored in magenta.

**Rule:**
- Paint the pink cell black only if it is not enclosed by the inner closed line;
  otherwise, reproduce the input verbatim.
