**Output:**
- Black background
- A couple of randomly placed, small objects:
  * One or more types of objects, each present multiple times
  * All objects consist of exactly two random, non-black colors
  * Different types within one example do not share any colors
  * Objects may connect via corners (connectivity 8)
  * Objects are at most 3Ã—3
  * Objects are point-symmetric
  * Instances are not overlapping or touching

**Inputs:**
- Based on output
- Most instances of objects have one color removed (turned to black/background)
- One instance of each object type remains intact

**Rule:**
- Restore objects from partial instances, taking the one intact copy as reference.
