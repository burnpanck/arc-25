**Outputs:**
- A pattern of many colors with a horizontal and a vertical symmetry axis
- The symmetry axes offset from the canvas center one cell to the right and bottom
- Parts of the pattern furthermore exhibit a 90° rotational symmetry

**Inputs:**
- Same as outputs, but with one or more parts overwritten by brown patches

**Rule:**
- Repair the areas indicated by the brown patches to restore symmetry
- Assume 90° symmetry for those areas that cannot be deduced using mirror symmetries only
