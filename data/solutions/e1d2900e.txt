**Inputs:**
- A number of red 2Ã—2 squares on black background
- Additionally a number of blue cells
- Blue cells may touch on corners, but not on sides

**Rule:**
- Blue cells are attracted towards the nearest red square
- If they are horizontally or vertically aligned with the square, they move until they touch
- Otherwise, they remain as is
