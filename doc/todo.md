# TODO
- Implement solution code outputing two alternate solutions
  - re-write some training example solutions to make use of that (horizontal/vertical are go-to's)
- Implement managing multiple alternate solutions in the DB and the explorer
- Implement managing iterative improval of a solution in the DB and the explorer
- Speculative decoding at inference!
